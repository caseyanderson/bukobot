# CURA

## Overview

In order to print objects (referred to as "parts") on the `Bukobot` you need an STL file (found online or created in a 3D modeling program) and a `slicing` application. Deezmaker and the MDP/Making lab both recommend [Cura](https://ultimaker.com/en/products/cura-software), which, when combined with `PronterfaceUI`, can both issue commands to the machine (referred to as "hosting") and divide one's file into small layers (referred to as "slicing").


## misc notes

## switching views

switching views: `Expert` > `Switch to quickprint` or `Switch to full settings`

`File` > `Preferences` > `Printing Window Type` > `Pronterface UI`

Then click ` Ok`

Sometimes the nozzle gets really, really jammed!
