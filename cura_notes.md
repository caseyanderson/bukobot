# CURA

## Overview

In order to print objects (referred to as "parts") on the `Bukobot` you need an STL file (found online or created in a 3D modeling program) and a `slicing` application. Deezmaker and the MDP/Making lab both recommend [Cura](https://ultimaker.com/en/products/cura-software), which, with the usage of `PronterfaceUI`


## misc notes

different views in Cura allow for different functionality. There is an expert and basic view but neither allow for issuing direct commands to the machine. In File > Preferences one can switch from default ui (or default ui or whatever) to "PronterfaceUI," which gives one more control over the machine.

switching views: `Expert` > `Switch to quickprint` or `Switch to full settings`

`File` > `Preferences` > `Printing Window Type` > `Pronterface UI`

Then click ` Ok`

Sometimes the nozzle gets really, really jammed!
